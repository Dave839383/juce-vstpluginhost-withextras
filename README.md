# juce-vstpluginhost-withextras
This adds Playback and a Midi Pattern Sequencer to the Audio Plugin Host that is supplied with the JUCE C++ library.  The Audio Plugin Host is generally used for testing VST plugins, and these features will allow the user to test with a working AudioPlayHead before moving the plugin to Logic/Pro Tools etc.
